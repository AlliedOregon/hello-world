Hello fellow Earthlings,

I'm Sam, a single Dad living in Portland, Oregon - studied design and sociology in college, and have close to zero experience coding. However it seems natural in my at-home learning/research regiment, so I'm excited to embark down the road. I love working with my hands, designed and built a tiny house on wheels back in '13 - huge space advocate - looking forward to the future :)!!

Come say hello, lets collab
